This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that uses a pseudo-class like `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive doesn't correctly handle these pseudo-classes and may not apply the styles as expected. For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This might not change the background color on hover.
